    introduction: "<p>Hi there, Iâ€™m Kevin Newman, a developer, designer and hobbyist living in Canada. I like to make responsive websites, captivating videos and 3D models. In my off time, you can usually find me playing/making some video games, working on a side project, or doodling some little drawings. I try to keep up with the current trends in technology by going to developer meetups in the area. </p><p>Currently working on a Unity game couch co-op multiplayer game. More to come soon.</p>",
